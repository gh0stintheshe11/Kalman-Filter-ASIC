========================================
Kalman Filter ASIC Top-Level Test
Per paper Figure 3 architecture
Mode: RTL simulation
========================================

Test operands:
  Value A (3.0) = 0x00c000 (3.0000)
  Value B (2.5) = 0x00a000 (2.5000)

--- Programming ROM ---
ROM programmed with 6 instructions

--- Test 1: Check initial READY state ---
PASS: System READY=1 after reset

--- Test 2: Load operands and execute program ---
DATA_IN = 0x00c000 (3.0)
START asserted - execution begins
DATA_IN = 0x00a000 (2.5)

Monitoring execution (port-level signals only):
Cycle | READY | DATA_OUT
------|-------|----------
    0 |   0   | xxxxxx
    1 |   0   | 016000
    2 |   0   | 016000
    3 |   0   | 016000
    4 |   1   | 016000

HALT detected - program completed at cycle 4

--- Test 3: Verify computation results ---

Data Bank contents (RTL mode):
  DB[0] = 0x00c000 (3.0000) - expected 3.0
  DB[1] = 0x00a000 (2.5000) - expected 2.5
  DB[2] = 0x016000 (5.5000) - expected 5.5 (ADD result)

PASS: ADD result correct (3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5)

--- Test 4: Verify system returned to READY ---
PASS: System READY=1 after HALT
