========================================
Testing Sequencer (per paper Section 4)
Instruction format: a4-a0 b4-b0 c1c0 d1d0 e f
========================================

--- Test 1: Check READY when idle ---
PASS: ready=1 when idle

--- Test 2: Start execution ---

--- PC=0: Normal step (INC) ---

--- PC=1: WAIT mode (stall test) ---
PASS: PC stalled at 1 during WAIT

--- Releasing WAIT with continue_i ---

--- PC=2: Normal step after WAIT ---

--- PC=3: HALT ---
PASS: ready=1 after HALT

========================================
sequencer_tb: PASS (31 checks)
========================================
Simulation complete via $finish(1) at time 156 NS + 0
