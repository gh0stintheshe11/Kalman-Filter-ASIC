The software has determined that multi-drive net pad_clk is comprised of  10012 timing arcs which is above the threshold of 10000 specified by the timing_reduce_multi_drive_net_arcs_threshold setting.  The net will be reduced to a single-driver model.  The reduction can affect SDF generation and annotation - you should consult the read_sdf documentation in the Command Reference for more information on controlling multi-drive net reduction and related SDF flow issues.
